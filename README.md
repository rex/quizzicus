A QUICK NOTE
---

Anyone with the savvy enough to search GitHub for `*.key` files, database configuration files, 
and server/service passwords would also be savvy enough to be able to find those items in the revision 
history if I just deleted them. So, since I don't feel like scrubbing each of those files from the 
version history I am leaving them here in all their glory. For me, they represent a time long before I was
good enough at this to realize that storing credentials and keys was **the worst possible idea**. 

So yeah. Have at them. Try and try and try if you'd like, but those passwords were changed long ago and the 
damn servers aren't even online anymore. Haven't been for a long, *long* time.
